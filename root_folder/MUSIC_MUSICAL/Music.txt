Music
=====

Overview
--------
Music is an art form whose medium is sound organized in time. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping. It plays a role in all human societies and is a cultural universal.

Origins and Ancient Music
-------------------------
Music has been an integral part of human culture for tens of thousands of years. Archaeological evidence includes bone flutes discovered in Germany and Slovenia dating back over 40,000 years, making music one of the oldest known human activities. Ancient civilizations developed sophisticated musical traditions: Mesopotamian texts describe musical instruments and scales; Egyptian tomb paintings depict harps, flutes, and percussion instruments; ancient Greek music theory, developed by Pythagoras and others, established mathematical relationships between musical intervals that remain foundational today. Indian classical music developed the raga system, a complex framework of melodic modes, while Chinese music theory established a pentatonic scale system. Music played essential roles in religious ceremonies, storytelling, warfare, healing, and social bonding across all ancient cultures. The oldest known musical composition is the Hurrian Hymn No. 6, a 3,400-year-old cuneiform tablet from ancient Syria.

Classical Music Periods
-----------------------
Western classical music is typically divided into several major periods. The Medieval period (500-1400) saw the development of Gregorian chant, organum, and early polyphony. The Renaissance (1400-1600) brought richer harmonies and the rise of secular music, with composers like Josquin des Prez and Palestrina. The Baroque period (1600-1750) introduced opera, the concerto, and the sonata, with towering figures like Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, and Antonio Vivaldi. The Classical period (1750-1820) emphasized clarity, balance, and formal structure, exemplified by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, and Ludwig van Beethoven. The Romantic period (1820-1900) expanded orchestral size and emotional range, with composers like Chopin, Liszt, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Brahms pushing the boundaries of harmony and expression. The 20th century saw radical experimentation, including impressionism (Debussy, Ravel), atonality and serialism (Schoenberg, Webern), neoclassicism (Stravinsky), minimalism (Reich, Glass, Riley), and electronic music. Each period built upon and reacted against its predecessors, creating a rich and diverse musical heritage.

Popular Music and Genres
------------------------
Popular music encompasses a wide range of genres that have developed primarily since the late 19th century. The blues, originating from African American communities in the Deep South, laid the foundation for jazz, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and hip-hop. Jazz emerged in New Orleans in the early 20th century, blending African rhythmic traditions with European harmonic structures. Legends like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane pushed jazz in increasingly sophisticated directions. Rock and roll emerged in the 1950s with pioneers like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley, evolving into diverse subgenres including psychedelic rock, punk rock, heavy metal, alternative rock, and indie rock. The British Invasion, led by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, transformed popular music worldwide. Hip-hop originated in the Bronx, New York, in the 1970s and has become the dominant global music genre, with artists like Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake shaping its evolution. Electronic dance music (EDM), pop, country, reggae, R&B, K-pop, and Latin music represent just a fraction of the diverse popular music landscape.

Music Theory and Elements
-------------------------
Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. The fundamental elements of music include melody (a sequence of notes perceived as a single entity), harmony (the simultaneous sounding of notes to create chords and chord progressions), rhythm (the pattern of beats and time), dynamics (variations in loudness), timbre (the quality or color of sound that distinguishes different instruments and voices), and form (the overall structure of a musical composition). Western music theory is based on a system of 12 chromatic notes, organized into major and minor scales, modes, and various other scale types. Key signatures, time signatures, and notation systems allow composers to precisely communicate their musical ideas. Counterpoint, the art of combining independent melodic lines, reached its pinnacle in the works of J.S. Bach. Modern music theory has expanded to encompass jazz harmony, post-tonal theory, set theory, and computational approaches to music analysis. Non-Western music systems, such as Indian ragas, Arabic maqams, and Indonesian gamelan scales, offer alternative theoretical frameworks that enrich global musical understanding.

Music Industry and Technology
-----------------------------
The music industry has undergone dramatic transformations driven by technological innovation. The invention of the phonograph by Thomas Edison in 1877 made recorded music possible for the first time. The 20th century saw the progression from vinyl records to cassette tapes to compact discs, each format changing how music was distributed and consumed. Radio broadcasting, beginning in the 1920s, made music accessible to mass audiences and launched the era of popular music stars. The advent of MTV in 1981 added a visual dimension to popular music, making music videos an essential promotional tool. The digital revolution, beginning with MP3 compression in the 1990s and accelerated by file-sharing platforms like Napster, disrupted traditional business models. Today, streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube dominate music distribution, generating billions of streams daily. Digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, and FL Studio have democratized music production, allowing anyone with a computer to create professional-quality recordings. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to compose, produce, and master music, raising questions about creativity and authorship. The global music industry generated over $28 billion in revenue in 2023.
