Philosophy
==========

Overview
--------
Philosophy is the systematized study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language. Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation. Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge, and a practitioner was known as a philosopher.

Ancient Philosophy
------------------
Ancient philosophy, spanning roughly from the 6th century BCE to the 6th century CE, laid the foundations for all subsequent Western philosophical thought. The Pre-Socratic philosophers, including Thales, Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, sought to explain the natural world through reason rather than mythology. Socrates (470-399 BCE) shifted philosophical inquiry toward ethics and the examined life, developing the Socratic method of systematic questioning. His student Plato (428-348 BCE) founded the Academy in Athens and developed the Theory of Forms, arguing that abstract, perfect ideals exist beyond the physical world. Plato's dialogues, including The Republic, Symposium, and Phaedo, remain among the most influential philosophical works ever written. Aristotle (384-322 BCE), Plato's student, founded the Lyceum and made groundbreaking contributions to logic, metaphysics, ethics, politics, biology, and aesthetics. His Nicomachean Ethics remains a cornerstone of virtue ethics. The Hellenistic period saw the development of Stoicism (Zeno, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius), Epicureanism (Epicurus, Lucretius), and Skepticism (Pyrrho, Sextus Empiricus). Roman philosophers including Cicero and Seneca synthesized and transmitted Greek philosophical ideas.

Modern Philosophy
-----------------
Modern philosophy, typically dated from the 17th century onward, was profoundly shaped by the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. René Descartes (1596-1650), often called the father of modern philosophy, established methodological doubt as a philosophical starting point, famously declaring 'Cogito, ergo sum' (I think, therefore I am). The rationalist tradition, including Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, emphasized reason as the primary source of knowledge. The empiricist tradition, including John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume, argued that knowledge derives primarily from sensory experience. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) synthesized rationalism and empiricism in his Critique of Pure Reason, arguing that the mind actively structures experience through innate categories. The 19th century produced diverse philosophical movements: German Idealism (Hegel, Fichte, Schelling), existentialism's precursors (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche), utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill), Marxism, and American pragmatism (Peirce, James, Dewey). The 20th century saw the development of analytic philosophy (Russell, Wittgenstein, Frege), phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty), existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir, Camus), and critical theory (the Frankfurt School).

Ethics and Moral Philosophy
---------------------------
Ethics, or moral philosophy, is concerned with questions about what is morally right and wrong, good and bad, just and unjust. Three major ethical frameworks dominate Western moral philosophy. Virtue ethics, originating with Aristotle, focuses on developing good character traits (virtues) such as courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom. A virtuous person, according to this view, will naturally act rightly. Deontological ethics, most associated with Immanuel Kant, emphasizes duty and moral rules. Kant's categorical imperative states that one should act only according to principles that could be universalized as laws for all rational beings. Consequentialism, particularly utilitarianism as developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, judges actions by their outcomes—the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number. Contemporary ethical debates address issues such as abortion, euthanasia, animal rights, environmental ethics, bioethics, business ethics, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. Applied ethics has become increasingly important in professional fields including medicine, law, engineering, and technology. Feminist ethics, care ethics, and global justice theories have expanded the scope of moral philosophy beyond its traditional Western, male-dominated perspective.

Eastern Philosophy
------------------
Eastern philosophical traditions, developing largely independently from Western philosophy, offer profound and distinctive perspectives on fundamental questions about existence, ethics, and knowledge. Hinduism, one of the world's oldest philosophical traditions, encompasses diverse schools of thought including Vedanta, Samkhya, Yoga, and Nyaya. Central concepts include dharma (duty/cosmic order), karma (action and consequence), samsara (cycle of rebirth), and moksha (liberation). Buddhism, founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th century BCE, teaches the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path as the way to end suffering (dukkha) and achieve nirvana. Buddhist philosophy has developed rich traditions in epistemology, logic, and metaphysics, including the Madhyamaka and Yogacara schools. Chinese philosophy is dominated by Confucianism, which emphasizes social harmony, filial piety, and moral cultivation, and Taoism (Daoism), which advocates living in harmony with the Tao (the Way) and embracing naturalness and simplicity. The Tao Te Ching and the Analects remain among the most influential philosophical texts in human history. Zen Buddhism, blending Buddhist and Taoist elements, emphasizes meditation and direct experience. Japanese philosophy includes unique developments such as the aesthetic concepts of wabi-sabi (beauty in imperfection) and mono no aware (the pathos of things).

Contemporary Philosophy
-----------------------
Contemporary philosophy encompasses a vast range of topics, methods, and traditions. The philosophy of mind grapples with the mind-body problem—the relationship between mental states and physical brain processes. The 'hard problem of consciousness,' articulated by David Chalmers, asks why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience. Philosophy of language, influenced by Wittgenstein, Austin, and Searle, examines how language relates to reality and thought. Political philosophy addresses justice, rights, liberty, and the proper role of government, with influential contributions from John Rawls (A Theory of Justice), Robert Nozick (libertarianism), and Martha Nussbaum (capabilities approach). Philosophy of science examines the nature, methods, and implications of scientific inquiry, including questions about falsifiability (Popper), paradigm shifts (Kuhn), and scientific realism. Environmental philosophy and animal ethics have grown significantly, with thinkers like Peter Singer arguing for the moral consideration of all sentient beings. The philosophy of technology and AI ethics have become increasingly urgent as artificial intelligence systems become more powerful and pervasive. Debates about free will, personal identity, the meaning of life, and the nature of reality continue to engage philosophers and the broader public alike.
