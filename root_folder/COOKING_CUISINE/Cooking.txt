Cooking
=======

Overview
--------
Cooking is the art, science, and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions. The way that cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training an individual cook has. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. The preparation of food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans.

History of Cooking
------------------
Archaeological evidence suggests that early humans first controlled fire around 1 million years ago, which marked the beginning of cooking. The earliest forms of cooking likely involved roasting meat and root vegetables over open flames. The invention of pottery around 20,000 years ago allowed humans to boil water and create soups and stews, dramatically expanding the range of edible foods. The expansion of agriculture around 10,000 years ago introduced grains, legumes, and domesticated animals into the human diet, leading to the development of bread-making, fermentation, and dairy processing. Ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, China, and India each developed distinctive culinary traditions that reflected their available ingredients, climate, and cultural values. The Silk Road and maritime trade routes facilitated the exchange of spices, herbs, and cooking techniques across continents, enriching global cuisine. The Middle Ages saw the rise of elaborate court cuisine in Europe, while the Columbian Exchange after 1492 introduced New World ingredients like tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, and chili peppers to the Old World, transforming cuisines worldwide.

Cooking Techniques
------------------
There are dozens of cooking techniques used around the world, each producing distinct flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles. Dry-heat methods include baking, roasting, grilling, broiling, sautéing, pan-frying, deep-frying, and stir-frying. These methods rely on hot air, oil, or direct contact with a heated surface to cook food, often creating caramelization and Maillard reactions that produce complex flavors and appealing browning. Moist-heat methods include boiling, simmering, poaching, steaming, braising, and stewing. These techniques use water or other liquids to transfer heat and are particularly effective for tenderizing tough cuts of meat and cooking delicate foods like fish and vegetables. Combination methods such as braising and stewing use both dry and moist heat. Modern techniques include sous vide (cooking food sealed in bags at precise temperatures in a water bath), molecular gastronomy (using scientific principles to create innovative dishes), smoking, curing, and fermentation. Each culture has developed signature techniques: Chinese wok cooking, Indian tandoori, Japanese tempura, French sautéing, and American barbecue, among many others.

Culinary Arts and Professions
-----------------------------
The culinary arts refer to the professional practice of preparing, cooking, and presenting food. Professional kitchens are typically organized according to the brigade system, developed by Auguste Escoffier in the late 19th century. This hierarchical system includes positions such as the executive chef (chef de cuisine), sous chef, line cooks (chefs de partie), pastry chefs, and apprentices. Culinary education has expanded significantly, with prestigious institutions like Le Cordon Bleu, the Culinary Institute of America, and Johnson & Wales University training thousands of chefs annually. The restaurant industry is one of the largest employers globally, providing jobs to millions of people. Food media, including cooking shows, food blogs, YouTube channels, and social media platforms, have made cooking more accessible and popular than ever. Celebrity chefs such as Julia Child, Gordon Ramsay, and Massimo Bottura have elevated cooking to an art form and cultural phenomenon.

Nutrition and Food Science
--------------------------
Understanding nutrition is an essential component of modern cooking. Macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—provide energy and building blocks for the body. Micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are required in smaller amounts but are crucial for health. Cooking can significantly affect the nutritional content of food: some nutrients are enhanced by cooking (such as lycopene in tomatoes), while others may be diminished (such as vitamin C in boiled vegetables). Food science explores the chemical and physical properties of food, including flavor compounds, texture, color, and preservation. Food safety is a critical concern, involving proper handling, storage, and cooking temperatures to prevent foodborne illness. The study of food science has led to innovations in food preservation (canning, freezing, dehydration), food additives, and the development of new food products. Dietary trends such as vegetarianism, veganism, ketogenic diets, Mediterranean diets, and farm-to-table movements reflect evolving understanding of nutrition and sustainability.

Global Cuisines
---------------
The world's cuisines reflect the incredible diversity of human culture and geography. French cuisine, known for its refinement and technique, emphasizes sauces, pastries, and wine pairings. Italian cuisine celebrates simplicity and quality ingredients, with staples like pasta, olive oil, and fresh vegetables. Chinese cuisine encompasses eight major regional traditions, each with distinct flavors and techniques. Japanese cuisine values seasonal ingredients, precise preparation, and aesthetic presentation. Indian cuisine features complex spice blends, diverse vegetarian options, and regional variations from creamy North Indian curries to tangy South Indian dosas. Mexican cuisine combines indigenous Mesoamerican traditions with Spanish influences, featuring corn, beans, chili peppers, and chocolate. Thai cuisine balances sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and spicy flavors in each dish. Middle Eastern cuisine features grilled meats, flatbreads, hummus, and aromatic spices. African cuisines are incredibly diverse, ranging from North African tagines to West African jollof rice to Ethiopian injera. The globalization of food has led to fusion cuisines and the worldwide availability of ingredients that were once regional specialties.
