History
=======

Overview
--------
History is the systematic study and documentation of the human past. The period of events before the invention of writing systems is considered prehistory. History is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.

Ancient Civilizations
---------------------
The earliest civilizations emerged in the fertile river valleys of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China between approximately 3500 and 2000 BCE. Mesopotamia, located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern-day Iraq, is often called the cradle of civilization. The Sumerians developed cuneiform writing, the wheel, and sophisticated irrigation systems. Ancient Egypt, unified around 3100 BCE under Pharaoh Narmer, produced monumental architecture including the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx. Egyptian civilization lasted over 3,000 years and made significant contributions to mathematics, medicine, and engineering. The Indus Valley Civilization (3300-1300 BCE) featured advanced urban planning with cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa having grid street patterns and sophisticated drainage systems. Ancient China's Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE) developed bronze working, oracle bone script, and complex social hierarchies. These early civilizations independently developed writing, mathematics, astronomy, law codes (such as Hammurabi's Code), and religious systems that profoundly influenced subsequent human development.

Classical Antiquity
-------------------
Classical antiquity encompasses the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, roughly from the 8th century BCE to the 5th century CE. Ancient Greece made foundational contributions to philosophy (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle), democracy (Athenian direct democracy), drama (tragedy and comedy), mathematics (Euclid, Pythagoras, Archimedes), history (Herodotus, Thucydides), and the Olympic Games. The Greek city-states, particularly Athens and Sparta, developed distinct political systems that have influenced Western thought for millennia. Alexander the Great's conquests (336-323 BCE) spread Greek culture across the Mediterranean and into Central Asia, creating the Hellenistic world. The Roman Republic, founded in 509 BCE, evolved into the Roman Empire under Augustus in 27 BCE. At its height, the Roman Empire controlled the entire Mediterranean basin, much of Western Europe, and parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Roman contributions include engineering marvels (aqueducts, roads, the Colosseum), legal systems that form the basis of many modern legal traditions, Latin language (ancestor of Romance languages), and the eventual adoption of Christianity as the state religion. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE traditionally marks the end of ancient history in Europe.

The Middle Ages
---------------
The Middle Ages, spanning roughly from the 5th to the 15th century, was a period of significant political, social, and cultural transformation in Europe and beyond. Following the fall of Rome, Western Europe fragmented into numerous kingdoms ruled by Germanic peoples, including the Franks, Visigoths, and Anglo-Saxons. The feudal system organized society into a hierarchy of lords, vassals, and serfs, with land ownership as the basis of power and wealth. The Catholic Church became the most powerful institution in medieval Europe, influencing politics, education, art, and daily life. Monasteries preserved classical learning and produced illuminated manuscripts. The Crusades (1095-1291) were a series of religious wars that had profound effects on European-Middle Eastern relations, trade, and cultural exchange. The Islamic Golden Age (8th-14th centuries) saw remarkable advances in science, mathematics, medicine, and philosophy, with scholars like Al-Khwarizmi, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Rushd making lasting contributions. The Mongol Empire (13th-14th centuries), the largest contiguous land empire in history, connected East and West through trade and cultural exchange. The Black Death (1347-1351) killed an estimated 30-60% of Europe's population, leading to profound social and economic changes.

The Modern Era
--------------
The modern era, beginning roughly in the 15th century, witnessed transformative events that shaped the contemporary world. The Renaissance (14th-17th centuries) was a cultural movement that began in Italy and spread across Europe, reviving interest in classical learning and producing masterworks by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael. The Age of Exploration (15th-17th centuries) saw European powers establish global trade networks and colonial empires, fundamentally altering the demographics and cultures of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The Protestant Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther in 1517, shattered the religious unity of Western Christianity and led to decades of religious warfare. The Scientific Revolution (16th-18th centuries) transformed understanding of the natural world through the work of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. The Enlightenment (17th-18th centuries) championed reason, individual liberty, and democratic governance, inspiring the American Revolution (1776) and the French Revolution (1789). The Industrial Revolution (late 18th-19th centuries) mechanized production, urbanized societies, and created new social classes. The 20th century was marked by two devastating World Wars, the Cold War, decolonization, the civil rights movement, and the digital revolution.

Historiography and Methods
--------------------------
Historiography refers to the study of historical writing and the methods historians use to investigate the past. Primary sources—documents, artifacts, and records created during the period being studied—form the foundation of historical research. Secondary sources, such as books and articles by historians, interpret and analyze primary sources. Historians employ various methodological approaches, including political history, social history, economic history, cultural history, and microhistory. The Annales School, founded in France in 1929, emphasized long-term social and economic structures over political events and individual leaders. Marxist historiography focuses on class struggle and economic forces as drivers of historical change. Postmodern approaches have questioned the objectivity of historical narratives and emphasized the role of language, power, and perspective in shaping our understanding of the past. Digital humanities and big data analytics are creating new opportunities for historical research, enabling scholars to analyze vast quantities of digitized texts, images, and records. Oral history, archaeological evidence, and interdisciplinary collaboration continue to expand our knowledge of the human past.
